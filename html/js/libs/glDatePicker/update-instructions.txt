The package includes 2 stylesheets:

- developr.css: fluid size calendar (new default behavior for the plugin)
- developr.fixed.css: fixed size calendar, same as old version

The new fluid design may not fit in every project, hence the two stylesheets. But you can mix both sizes too: include developr.css (so datepickers will be fluid by default), and initialize the plugin like this for datepickers which require a fixed size:

$('input').glDatePicker({
    cssName: 'default fixed'
});
